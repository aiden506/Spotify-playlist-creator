# Spotify Playlist Creator

Convert your private "Liked Songs" on Spotify into a public playlist—instantly shareable with friends, family, or collaborators.

## 🚀 Overview

This project solves a common limitation in Spotify’s ecosystem: users cannot directly share their "Liked Songs" as a playlist. The **Spotify Playlist Creator** addresses this by automatically copying all liked songs into a newly created public playlist—making sharing effortless.

This was my **first-ever Python project**, built while learning the language. It originated from a personal frustration and was co-developed with a friend as a practical introduction to real-world programming. The solution still solves a problem that persists even in 2025.
